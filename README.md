# Customer Churn Analysis in the Telecom Industry 📊

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry to understand customer behavior, reduce churn, and develop actionable marketing strategies. Using machine learning and data exploration techniques, the project aims to predict churn and provide insights for customer retention. The insights gained will help telecom companies enhance customer satisfaction and optimize service offerings.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):**
  - Conducted univariate analysis to understand key variables.
  - Explored correlations using heatmaps.
  - Identified patterns and trends that could help reduce churn.
  - Bivariate analysis was identified as a future enhancement for deeper insights.
  
- **Key Insights:**
  - Interesting trends were uncovered, providing a basis for targeted marketing strategies and retention plans.

- **Model Development:**
  - Built a predictive model using **SMOTEENN** (a combination of oversampling and undersampling) with a **Decision Tree Classifier**.
  - Achieved improvements in **accuracy, F1-score, and precision** by addressing class imbalance effectively.
